# Introduction

Moonlit Tales is a lightweight and streamlined modlist with the very best modded content, creation club and survival support as well as excellent performance. It's designed to take up as little hard drive space as possible while still providing a performance friendly and beautiful graphics overhaul and enough content to discover for existing and new players.

## List Contents

You can find a summary of all changes on the [Gameplay Changes](GAMEPLAY.md) page.

## Minimum Specs
Users have reported running the list fine with as low as a Ryzen 1300x and a GTX960. You may need to use performance ini files (included) with systems this low but it should run fine and still look great!

## Community

Support is offered in [The Lost Outpost](https://discord.gg/WF66mMu) server and in the [Issues](https://github.com/Lost-Outpost/moonlit-tales/issues) section of the Moonlit Tales GitHub. If you have any questions following the add-on's instructions or if you find a typo or any other mistake in the documentation, feel free to report in The Lost Outpost Discord server's support channel.

# Installation

Installation is handled through [GDLauncher](https://gdlauncher.com/) with a one-click install of the modlist. There are some pre-installation steps which must be followed for first time users so please pay attention to those.

## Pre-Install

These steps are only needed if you install the Modlist for the first time. If you are updating the Modlist, jump straight to [Updating](#updating).
