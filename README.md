# Introduction

"So... a Moonlit Tales appears, at this moment in the turning of the age." - Arngeir

Moonlit Tales is a lightweight vanilla+ rpg modpack for minecraft with the best additional modded content.

## List Contents

You can find a summary of all changes on the [Gameplay Changes](GAMEPLAY.md) page.

## Minimum Specs
Users have reported running the list fine with as low as a Ryzen 1300x and a GTX960. You may need to use performance ini files (included) with systems this low but it should run fine and still look great!

## Community

Support is offered in [The Lost Outpost](https://discord.gg/WF66mMu) server and in the [Issues](https://github.com/Lost-Outpost/moonlit-tales/issues) section of the Moonlit Tales GitHub. If you have any questions following the add-on's instructions or if you find a typo or any other mistake in the documentation, feel free to report in The Lost Outpost Discord server's support channel.

# Installation

Installation is handled through [GDLauncher](https://gdlauncher.com/) with a one-click install of the modlist. There are some pre-installation steps which must be followed for first time users so please pay attention to those.

## Pre-Install
